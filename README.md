QUESTIONS

<ol>
<li>Write a program that uses the Heap-Sort algorithm for sorting a given input sequence of integers present in an array A in non-decreasing order and prints the number of comparisons performed during sorting. Your program must contain the following functions: (the notation A[i..j] denotes the sub-array of A, contained within the ith and jth indices, both inclusive).
<ul>
<li>A recursive function Max-Heapify(A, i) that takes as input an array A and lets the value at A[i] ‚Äúfloat down‚Äù in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index i obeys the max-heap property.</li>
<li>A function Build-Max-Heap(A) that takes as input an array A and build a max-heap on the input array A[1‚Ä¶n] where n is equal to A.length.</li>
<li>A function Heapsort(A) that takes as input an array A and sorts an array A in place. Input format:
‚Ä¢ The first line of the input contains an integer n ‚àà [1, 105 ], the size of the array A.

‚Ä¢ The second line lists the n elements in A, as space-separated integers in the range [‚àí103 , 103 ].

Output Format:

‚Ä¢ The first line of the output contains the elements of A in sorted order, separated by space.

‚Ä¢ The second line of the output contains the number of comparisons performed during sorting.

Note:

The number of comparisons made by Heap-Sort is highly dependent on its implementation. As such, we will be considering the number of comparisons as per the algorithm given in CLRS.

Sample Input:

<li>Radhika works in the HR department of a software company situated in Bangalore. Her company came to NITC for the recruitment process. They conducted a written test for the students and published a rank list based on the test and other criteria for conducting the interview. There is no more than one student with the same rank, and every student is assigned a unique rank and ID. On the interview day, the students are requested to be in a queue according to their rank. When a new student arrives, he/she will be positioned in the queue based on his/her rank (smaller the value, higher the rank). Every time, the highest-ranked student from the queue will be called for the interview.
As a placement cell coordinator, your job is to help Radhika to :

<ul>
<li>Place the arriving students in the priority queue accordingly. The highest-ranked student will be in the front (smaller the rank value, higher the priority).</li>
<li>Pick the highest-ranked student from the queue and send him to the interview panel. Then rearrange the queue so that the highest-ranked student comes to the front.
Create an array of structures S that stores the following details of each student:

Student id Student name Rank

3. Consider a set of Amoebas each having a unique name. Amoebas have a special property that two of them can combine together to form a bigger one. Write a program to combine the given set of amoebas until you are left with a single amoeba. The amoebas in the given set are combined based on the following criteria:

<ul>
<li>Amoeba with the smallest size will have the highest priority.</li>
<li>If two or more amoebas have the same size then amoeba who come first in the the alphabetical
order of their names will have the highest priority.
</li>
<li>At a time, only two of the amoebas who have the first two highest priorities can combine together to form the new amoeba.</li>
<li>The new amoeba can take the name of the amoeba who has the highest priority among the combining two amoebas.
Create an array of structures W that stores the following details of each amoeba: Amoeba Name

Amoeba Size

Write a program that implements priority queue (using heap) and the following functions as per the given function prototypes:

<ul>
<li>READ(a) ‚Äì Read the Amoeba Name and Amoeba Size of each amoeba to the structure a.</li>
<li>INSERT(W, a) ‚Äì Insert amoeba a in to the priority queue W.</li>
<li>COMBINE(W) ‚Äì Find the two amoebas with the highest priorities. Print their names in the decreasing order of their priority followed by the size of the newly formed amoeba. Return the details of the newly formed amoeba.
Input format:

<ul>
<li>The first line of the input contains an integer n ‚àà [1,103],the size of the structure array W.</li>
<li>The next n lines lists the elements in W where each line contains a string S ‚àà [A ‚àí Z, a ‚àí z], where |S| ‚â§ 20 specifying the name of the amoeba Amoeba Name followed by an integer k ‚àà [1, 103], specifying the size of an amoeba, Amoeba Size.

4. A hospital emergency room treats patients according to the severity of his/her health problems. Whenever a new patient is admitted to the hospital, a token number is assigned to the patient based on the seriousness of illness. This token number indicates the priority value ‚Äì lesser the value, higher the priority.

Write a menu driven program to implement the above scenario as a P atient Scheduling Application, using a Priority Queue, Q (implemented as heap). Implement the following operations:

<ul>
<li>Main() ‚Äì repeatedly reads a character ‚Äòi‚Äô, ‚Äòe‚Äô, ‚Äòm ‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô, ‚Äòd‚Äô or ‚Äòs‚Äô from the terminal and calls the sub-functions appropriately until character ‚Äùs‚Äù is entered.</li>
<li>Insert-Patient(Q, k) ‚Äì Inserts a new patient with token number k into the Queue Q.</li>
<li>Extract-Next-Patient(Q) ‚Äì Get the token number of the patient to be treated next and
remove his/her priority from the queue.
</li>
<li>Get-Next-Patient(Q) ‚Äì Get the token number of the patient to be treated next, from the
Queue Q without removing it.
</li>
<li>Change-Token-Number(Q, k, x) ‚Äì Change the token number of a patient from old value k to new value x in Queue Q. Assume that token number k is present in the Queue and x is lower than the current token number k.</li>
<li>Display-Queue(Q) ‚Äì Display all patients‚Äô token numbers in the Queue Q in the order of their treatment (patient with lowest token number is treated first) without changing the queue.
Input format:

<ul>
<li>The first line of the input contains a character from ‚Äòi‚Äô, ‚Äòe‚Äô, ‚Äòm‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô, ‚Äòd‚Äô, ‚Äòs‚Äô followed by at most two integers. The integers, if given, are in the range [1,106].</li>
<li>Character ‚Äòi‚Äô is to insert the next integer, from the input into the Queue. Character ‚Äòi‚Äô and integer are separated by space.</li>
<li>Character ‚Äòe‚Äô is to remove and print the patient with lowest token number from the Queue Q. 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>Character ‚Äòm‚Äô is to print the patient with lowest token number from the Queue Q without removing it.</li>
<li>Character ‚Äòc‚Äô is to change the token number of a patient in the Queue. In this case, character ‚Äòc‚Äô is followed by two more integers, each separated by space. After this operation, the patient‚Äôs token number with first integer is decreased to the second integer.</li>
<li>The character ‚Äòd‚Äô is to display all patients‚Äô token numbers in the Queue in the order of their treatment (Patient with lowest token number is treated first) without changing the queue.</li>
<li>The character ‚Äòs‚Äô is to ‚Äòstop‚Äô the program.
Output Format:

<ul>
<li>The output (if any) of each command should be printed on a separate line.</li>
<li>For option ‚Äòe‚Äô, remove and print the patient with lowest token number from the priority queue.
If the Queue is empty, then print ‚àí1.
</li>
<li>For option ‚Äòm‚Äô, print the patient with lowest token number in the Queue. If the Queue is
empty, then print ‚àí1.
</li>
<li>For option ‚Äòd‚Äô, display all patients‚Äô token numbers in the Queue in the order in which they will get treatment (patient with lowest token number is treated first). Each token number should be separated by space.
